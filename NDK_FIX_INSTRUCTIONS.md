# NDK Version Fix Instructions

## The Problem
The error indicates that NDK version 27.0.12077973 is not properly installed or the source.properties file is missing.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Use Flutter's Default NDK (Recommended)
I've already updated your `build.gradle.kts` to use `flutter.ndkVersion` instead of a hardcoded version. This should work with your current setup.

### Option 2: Install Compatible NDK Version
If you want to use a specific NDK version, you can install it through Android Studio:

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Go to SDK Manager**: Tools â†’ SDK Manager
3. **Click on SDK Tools tab**
4. **Check "Show Package Details"**
5. **Find "NDK (Side by side)" and install version 26.1.10909125**

### Option 3: Remove NDK Version Specification
If the above doesn't work, we can remove the NDK version entirely.

## Try Running Again

After the changes I made, try running your app again:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## If Still Not Working

If you still get NDK errors, we can use one of these fallback approaches:

1. **Remove NDK version entirely** - Let Flutter handle it automatically
2. **Use an older, more stable NDK version**
3. **Update your Android SDK/NDK through Android Studio**

## Alternative: Update Your Android SDK
Sometimes the issue is with the Android SDK setup. You can:

1. **Open Android Studio**
2. **Go to SDK Manager**
3. **Update Android SDK to latest version**
4. **Install latest NDK version**

Try running `flutter run` now and let me know if you get any errors!
